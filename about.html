    <h1>Who is Doctor Dan Hund?</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 24px" "font-family:'Courier New'">Dr. Dan Hund is the "Dr. Doolittle" of the Pasdena area. He grew up here and went off to school and came right back to serve his own community. And for this compassion and enthusiasm for the pet world, we are truly fortuante to have such an asset for our little loved ones.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 24px" "font-family:'Courier New'">Dr. Hund attended Pasadena City College for the first two years of his college career, which saved him from a bit of financial hardship in the beginning. After receiving his Associates in Biology, he moved on to Cal State East Bay where he finished this Bacherlor's Degree in Biological Sciences and minored in Chamistry. He also gained a certificate for Veterinary Assistant in order to get even more hand-on experience with all different kinds of animals. Once he graduated Cal State he moved directly into the MPVM Dual Degree Program for his Masters. At this point, he went on to obatain his PhD. in Veterinary Medicine and after a few years at another clinic, ventured out and started his own clinic, where he is still practicing today.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 24px" "font-family:'Courier New'">Every couple of years, he will volunteer his time and money to help spay and neuter cats and dogs. even administer shots, for those who cannot ordinarily afford it. He will even pull teeth or do simple splints at some of this donation clinics. He has enriched many peoples' lives who would not normally be able to have such rewarding companionship.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 24px" "font-family:'Courier New'">He is often seen at workshops, seminars and occassionally lecturing to future veterinary students to nurture and promote his love for being the best Vet he can possibly be and hopes to inspire others to do the same. With his vast knowlege, he is able to care for typical household pets, exotic pets and even farm animals. He has even assisted in some marine biology projects to further learn about our aquatic friends. When you go to his clinic, at some point you will have the opportunity to see his impressive array of degrees, certifcations, licensures and honoraries.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 24px" "font-family:'Courier New'">P.S. And he will not be offended if you call him "Dr. Dan" or "Doggie Dan". Heck, he will even accept "Dr. Doolittle"! He is truly a down-to-earth gentleman.</p>
